## Prediction using Supervised ML


##### Predicting the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours
##### This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
##### Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
##### I've predicted the percentage score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day.
##### Evaluated the model using following metrics: Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), Mean Squared Error(MSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
